Health Tracker – Python Console Application


---

1. Problem Statement

Many people want a simple and offline method to keep track of their daily health metrics such as weight, steps walked, sleep duration, and personal notes.
Most digital health apps are complex, require internet connectivity, or collect user data.
There is a need for a lightweight, privacy-friendly, and easy-to-use tool that helps users record and monitor their health metrics consistently.

This project solves that problem by providing a simple Python-based console application that stores all data locally in a text file and offers essential tracking features.
